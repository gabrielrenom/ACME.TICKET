ADM Interview Scenario

Purpose

This scenario is given to the candidate 2-3 days before they are asked to come in for a face-

to-face interview. The short time frame is intended to put pressure on the candidate to put

together a compelling presentation with the right detail, which can be typical of the ADM role.

Information to Candidate

Logistics:  The audience (ADMs) will be acting as a fictional ISV customer for whom you

are the Application Development Manager (ADM) as such you can assume most of the team

will know you and so limited introductions are necessary.

You should target your presentation to be 25-30 minutes long and afterwards you should

expect a Q&amp;A session which may last around 5-10 minutes

Scenario:  Our development team of fifteen people, experienced in C#, .NET and ASP.NET

and with some delivery of other software projects, are about to embark on building an

Internet facing Ticketing Application on the Microsoft Application Platform. In order to cope

with projected high peaks in demand from 1000s of users, reduce latency in the initial

response and to  scale appropriately, we plan to implement a queuing mechanism in-

between the ticketing application and our SQL Server data store. Microsoft offers a number

of technology choices and we’d like your advice on which one is the most appropriate.

We need:

- An overview of the pros/cons of the queuing technologies

- A recommendation of which one makes sense

- Some examples of the programming model to send/receive from a Queue.

- A high level plan of activities the ADM contract can deliver, over the next 6 months, to

assist in successful start to this project.

Unfortunately, we aren’t able to take advantage of using Windows Azure at this time so the

solution will be hosted in our own Data Centre.

Audience and Assessment

The audience for the presentation should consist of a 4+ people and some people in the

audience should take on a role and ask role appropriate questions:

 A developer who focuses on the technical detail for the technologies presented and

recommended.

 An architect who is concerned about correct technology selection, performance and

is generally sceptical of technologies not used before and the team’s capability.

 A delivery manager who is concerned about the implications of failure of the project

and whether Microsoft as an organisation is correctly supporting and bought into

what they are trying to do.

The candidate should have created good PowerPoint deck with clear and concise

information, supporting diagrams and fully covers the brief. The preference is for the

candidate to use Visual Studio and demonstrate some examples but static walkthrough of

code is acceptable (having no code based example would be considered an issue).

Presentation style should be confident, build rapport etc. (would they be OK in-front of

customers, do the project the right image). Finally, they should respond to questions

appropriately and ‘manage the room’.
